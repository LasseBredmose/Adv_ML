**Meeting 1/3**
 * Resize the picture - Strecthing the picture
 * Dataloader should be done for next time
 * Difficult task to classify normal and abnormal bones
 * Start by classifying what type of bone we are looking at
 * Easier to explain/classify given our limited bagground in human anatomy
 * To parts after the CNN
 * Do the baysian and do the explanation - Split it up
 * Explanation: 
   * Looking at the gradient through out the network
 * Baysian part:
   * Good certainty on the predictions
   * Laplace approx library: Laplace redux
     * take pytorch library and give approxmiations
 * Bayesian networks are different from bayesian neural netwokrs(we are doing the neural part)
 * The Bayesian network builds upon the CNN - we just keep track on different things and then do the some prediction in the end
 * We don't need to worry so much about the paper - More of a guideline
